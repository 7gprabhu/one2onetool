In this portion of the assignment, I have the use of code pipelines to perform the Continuous Integration when a new commit is performed.

I have also created 2 branches, a "release" which was previously the master and a "staging" branch, both with a "buildspec.yml" file. If you make the changes in "staging" branch, will automatically update and deploy.

You can view the public project here

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to take on the assignment.
