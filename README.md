# one2onetool

In this portion of the assignment, I have the use of code pipelines to perform the Continuous Integration when a new commit is performed.

I have also created 2 branches, a "release" which was previously the master and a "staging" branch, both with a "buildspec.yml" file.

You can view the public project <a href="one2onetool-lb-383058273.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to take on the assignment.
